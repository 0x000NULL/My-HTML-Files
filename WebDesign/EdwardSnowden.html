    <div class="Snow_Background"><p>Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, former <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> employee, and former contractor for the United States government who copied and leaked classified information from the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> in 2013 without authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> and the <abbr title="Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance">FEIA</abbr> with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments.<br>
<br>
In 2013, Snowden was hired by an <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr>. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in <cite>The Guardian</cite> and <cite>The Washington Post</cite>. Further disclosures were made by other publications including <cite>Der Spiegel</cite> and <cite>The New York Times</cite>.<br>
<br>
On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. Two days later, he flew into Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, but Russian authorities noted that his U.S. passport had been cancelled and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia ultimately granted him right of asylum for one year, and repeated extensions have permitted him to stay at least until 2020. He reportedly lives in an undisclosed location in Moscow, and continues to seek asylum elsewhere in the world.<br>
<br>
A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a traitor and a patriot. His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy.</p></div>

        <h3>Childhood, family, and education</h3>
<p>
    Edward Joseph Snowden was born on June 21, 1983, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. His maternal grandfather, Edward J. Barrett, was a rear admiral in the U.S. Coast Guard who became a senior official with the FBI and was at the Pentagon in 2001 during the September 11 attacks. Snowden's father, Lonnie Snowden, was also an officer in the Coast Guard, and his mother, Elizabeth "Barrett" Wendy Snowden, is chief deputy at the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. His older sister, Jessica, was a lawyer at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C. Snowden said that "in one way or another", his entire family has been employed by the federal government, and that he "expected to pursue the same path". His parents divorced in 2001, and his father remarried. Snowden scored above 145 on two separate IQ tests.<br>
<br>
In the early 1990s, while still in grade school, Snowden moved with his family to the area of Fort Meade, Maryland. Mononucleosis caused him to miss high school for almost nine months. Rather than returning to school, he passed the GED test and took classes at Anne Arundel Community College. Although Snowden had no undergraduate college degree, he worked online toward a master's degree at the University of Liverpool, England, in 2011. He was reportedly interested in Japanese popular culture, had studied the Japanese language, and worked for an anime company that had a resident office in the U.S. He also said he had a basic understanding of Mandarin Chinese and was deeply interested in martial arts. At age 20, he listed Buddhism as his religion on a military recruitment form, noting that the choice of Agnostic was "strangely absent."
<br>
    <br>
Political views
Snowden has said that in the 2008 presidential election, he voted for a third-party candidate. He has stated that he had been planning to comment on <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> surveillance programs at the time, but he decided to wait because he "believed in Obama's promises." He was later disappointed with President Barack Obama, saying that his policies were a continuation of those espoused by George W. Bush.
<br>
    <br>
A week after publication of his leaks began, technology news provider Ars Technica confirmed that Snowden had been an active participant at the site's online forum from 2001 through May 2012, discussing a variety of topics under the pseudonym "TheTrueHOOHA". In a January 2009 entry, TheTrueHOOHA exhibited strong support for the United States' security state apparatus and said he believed leakers of classified information "should be shot in the balls". However, Snowden developed a deep aversion to Obama. He disliked Obama's <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> director appointment of Leon Panetta, saying "Obama just named a fucking politician to run the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr>". Snowden was also offended by a possible ban on assault weapons, writing “Me and all my lunatic, gun-toting NRA compatriots would be on the steps of Congress before the C-Span feed finished”. Snowden showed a dislike to Obama's economic policies, was against Social Security, and favored Ron Paul's call for a return to the gold standard.
<br>
    <br>
In accounts published in June 2013, interviewers noted that Snowden's laptop displayed stickers supporting Internet freedom organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Tor Project. Snowden stated that he was "neither traitor nor hero. I'm an American."
<br>
    <br>
In 2014 Snowden stated that "women have the right to make their own choices" and supported providing "a basic income for people who have no work, or no meaningful work".
<br>
    <br>
Career
On May 7, 2004, Snowden enlisted in the United States Army Reserve as a Special Forces candidate through its 18X enlistment option, but he did not complete the training. He said he wanted to fight in the Iraq War because he "felt like [he] had an obligation as a human being to help free people from oppression." Snowden said he was discharged after breaking both legs in a training accident. He was discharged on September 28, 2004.
<br>
    <br>
He was then employed for less than a year in 2005 as a "security specialist" at the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Study of Language, a research center sponsored by the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr>. According to the University this is not a classified facility,[38] though it is heavily guarded. In June 2014, Snowden told Wired that this was "a top-secret facility" where his job as a security guard required a high-level security clearance, for which he passed a polygraph exam and underwent a stringent background check.
<br>
    <br>
<h3>Employment at <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr></h3>
After attending a 2006 job-fair focused on intelligence agencies, Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr>. The Agency assigned him to the global communications division at <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> headquarters in Langley, Virginia.
<br>
    <br>
In May 2006 Snowden wrote in Ars Technica that he had no trouble getting work because he was a "computer wizard". After distinguishing himself as a junior employee on the top computer-team, Snowden was sent to the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr>'s secret school for technology specialists, where he lived in a hotel for six months while studying and training full-time.
<br>
    <br>
In March 2007 the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security. Assigned to the U.S. mission to the United Nations, Snowden received a diplomatic passport and a four-bedroom apartment near Lake Geneva. According to Greenwald, while there Snowden was "considered the top technical and cybersecurity expert" in that country and "was hand-picked by the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> to support the president at the 2008 NATO summit in Romania". Snowden described his <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> experience in Geneva as "formative", stating that the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home. Snowden said that when the latter was arrested, a <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> operative offered to help in exchange for the banker becoming an informant. Ueli Maurer, President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2013, in June of that year publicly disputed Snowden's claims. "This would mean that the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> successfully bribed the Geneva police and judiciary. With all due respect, I just can't imagine it," said Maurer. In February 2009 Snowden resigned from the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr>.<br>
<br>
<abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> sub-contractee as an employee for Dell
In 2009, Snowden began work as a contractee for Dell, which manages computer systems for multiple government agencies. Assigned to an <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> facility at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo, Snowden instructed top officials and military officers on how to defend their networks from Chinese hackers. During his four years with Dell, he rose from supervising <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> computer system upgrades to working as what his résumé termed a "cyberstrategist" and an "expert in cyber counterintelligence" at several U.S. locations. In 2011, he returned to Maryland, where he spent a year as lead technologist on Dell's <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr> account. In that capacity, he was consulted by the chiefs of the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr>'s technical branches, including the agency's chief information officer and its chief technology officer. U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the investigation said Snowden began downloading documents describing the government's electronic spying programs while working for Dell in April 2012. Investigators estimated that of the 50,000 to 200,000 documents Snowden gave to Greenwald and Poitras, most were copied by Snowden while working at Dell.
<br>
    <br>
In March 2012, Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead technologist for the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr>'s information-sharing office. At the time of his departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15 months inside the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr>'s Hawaii regional operations center, which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea, the last three of which were with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. While intelligence officials have described his position there as a "system administrator," Snowden has said he was an "infrastructure analyst," which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world. On March 15, 2013—three days after what he later called his "breaking point" of "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress"—Snowden quit his job at Dell. Although he has stated that his "career high" annual salary was $200,000. Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at Booz Allen, where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr>'s worldwide surveillance activity. According to a Reuters story by Mark Hosenball, while in Hawaii, Snowden "may have persuaded between 20 and 25 fellow workers" to give him their logins and passwords "by telling them they were needed for him to do his job as a computer systems administrator." NBC News reported that the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> sent a memo to Congress and "[w]hile the memo's account is sketchy, it suggests that, contrary to Snowden's statements, he used an element of trickery to retrieve his trove of tens of thousands of classified documents."This report was disputed, with Snowden himself saying in January 2014, "With all due respect to Mark Hosenball, the Reuters report that put this out there was simply wrong. I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers." Booz Allen terminated Snowden's employment on June 10, 2013, one month after he had left the country.
<br>
    <br>
A former <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> co-worker told Forbes that although the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> was full of smart people, Snowden was "a genius among geniuses," who created a backup system for the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> that was widely implemented and often pointed out security bugs to the agency. The former colleague said Snowden was given full administrator privileges, with virtually unlimited access to <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> data. Snowden was offered a position on the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr>'s elite team of hackers, Tailored Access Operations, but turned it down to join Booz Allen.
    <br>
<br>
A source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" told Reuters that hiring screeners for Booz Allen had found some details of Snowden's education that "did not check out precisely," but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known. The résumé stated that Snowden attended computer-related classes at Johns Hopkins University. A spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins said that the university did not find records to show that Snowden attended the university, and suggested that he may instead have attended Advanced Career Technologies, a private for-profit organization which operated as "Computer Career Institute at Johns Hopkins." The University College of the University of Maryland acknowledged that Snowden had attended a summer session at a UM campus in Asia. Snowden's résumé stated that he estimated that he would receive a University of Liverpool computer security master's degree in 2013. The university said that Snowden registered for an online master's degree program in computer security in 2011 but that "he is not active in his studies and has not completed the program."<br>
<br>
Snowden has said that he had told multiple employees and two supervisors about his concerns, but the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> disputes his claim. Snowden elaborated in January 2014, saying "[I] made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co-workers, supervisors, and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen. The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled, but no one was willing to risk their jobs, families, and possibly even freedom to go through what [Thomas Andrews] Drake did." In March 2014, during testimony to the European Parliament, Snowden wrote that before revealing classified information he had reported "clearly problematic programs" to ten officials, who he said did nothing in response. In a May 2014 interview, Snowden told NBC News that after bringing his concerns about the legality of the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> spying programs to officials, he was told to stay silent on the matter:
<br>
        <blockquote>"The <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> has records—they have copies of emails right now to their Office of General Counsel, to their oversight and compliance folks from me raising concerns about the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr>'s interpretations of its legal authorities. I had raised these complaints not just officially in writing through email, but to my supervisors, to my colleagues, in more than one office. I did it in Fort Meade. I did it in Hawaii. And many, many of these individuals were shocked by these programs. They had never seen them themselves. And the ones who had, went, "You know, you're right. ... But if you say something about this, they're going to destroy you".</blockquote>
<br>
In May 2014, U.S. officials released a single email that Snowden had written in April 2013 inquiring about legal authorities but said that they had found no other evidence that Snowden had expressed his concerns to someone in an oversight position. In June 2014, the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> said it had not been able to find any records of Snowden raising internal complaints about the agency's operations. That same month, Snowden explained that he himself has not produced the communiqués in question because of the ongoing nature of the dispute, disclosing for the first time that "I am working with the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> in regard to these records and we're going back and forth, so I don't want to reveal everything that will come out."
<br>
    <br>
In his May 2014 interview with <cite>NBC News</cite>, Snowden accused the U.S. government of trying to use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a "low level analyst." In his words, he was "trained as a spy in the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine." He said he'd worked for the <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading." In a June interview with Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he "was actually functioning at a very senior level." In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> career, "I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting." Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, "I would sit down with the CIO of the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr>, the CTO of the <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency"> CIA</abbr>, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job to come up with a way to fix them."<br>
<br>
<p> Of his time as an <abbr title="National Security Agency" >NSA</abbr> analyst, directing the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment when he and his colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people." As Snowden observed it, this behavior was routine, happening "probably every two months," but was never reported, being considered among "the fringe benefits of surveillance positions."
